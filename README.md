# Power Outage Analysis
## By Andrew Chen

# Introduction

Power outages can have widespread impacts, disrupting daily life, businesses, and emergency services. The ability to predict the number of customers affected during an outage is crucial for infrastructure planning, disaster preparedness, and improving grid resilience. By understanding the key factors that contribute to large-scale outages, utility companies and policymakers can better allocate resources, improve response times, and minimize disruptions.

In this project, I analyze a dataset of major power outages across different states in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. This dataset not only includes information on major outages but also geographical locations, regional climatic conditions, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, and economic factors of the states affected.

Central Research Question
This project is centered around the following question:

How can we predict the number of customers affected by a power outage based on available outage characteristics?
By modeling outage severity in terms of affected customers, we aim to identify the key factors that contribute to large-scale outages and develop a predictive framework that could assist with risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
